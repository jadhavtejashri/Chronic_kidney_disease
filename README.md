# Chronic_kidney_disease
In this project machine learning algorithm is used to detect whether the person will suffer from chronic kidney disease or not. CSV file is attached which contains all the training and test datasets. Chronic kidney disease depends upon various factors like, specific gravity, albumin, sugar, red blood cells, pus cell, bacteria and many more.

Using following supervised machine learning techniques to build an optimized classification model for chronic kidney disease classification.

1 K-Nearest Neighbour classifier

2 Decision tree classifier
 
3 Random forest classifier

4 Ada Boost classifier

5 Gradient Boosting classifier

6 XGB classifier

7 Cat Boost classifier

8 Extre Tress classifier

9 LGBM classifier

Following libraries are used:

Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly,Sklearn
